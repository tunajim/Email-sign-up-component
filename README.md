## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a helpful review of JavaScript form validation.  Since we are not sending the information to a back-end server to be sanitized and stored, we had to control how the HTML form behaves.  This is done by preventing its default behavior on submit, while checking to see if the user has properly filled out the form. Depending on whether the form entry is valid or not, we will store the user's input into a variable and use string interpolation to display the success message.  


### Continued development

My goals are to continue honing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills and learn the best practices for writing accessible applications.
